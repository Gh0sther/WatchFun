<h2><p>Hidden in the shadows there always had been the night creatures between us. Lycans and vampires. Mortal enemies killing each other
along the  centuries.

  <p>A medical student was been involved into the war by accident. The Lycans were trying to catch him alive . And one of the elite vampires
  killed a few them and saved the human .Apparently the value of the human was huge for both species</p>
