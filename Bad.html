<h1> Bad Boys </h1>

<br>
  <br>
<h2>  <p> A huge amount of drug was kept under the guard of the anti-drug department until some thieves stolen it by a tunnel. 
  The plan of the thieves was simple. Make a deal to sell the drugs. Unfortunately one of the thieves fucked up and there was one
  witness who could destroy their plan.
 </p>
  <br>
  
  <p> A couple of police officers  were assigned to find the drug and the thieves. With the witness under their protection they
  became from hunters to hunted.
