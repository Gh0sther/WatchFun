<h1>  The Feloship of the Ring </h1>

<br>
  <br>
<h2>  <p> Long time ago the Dark Lord forged the mighty ring.One powerful item to conquer the middle earth.
A great alliance was reunited between elves and men to defeat the evil.The dark lord was defeated but sadly the ring was destroyed. 
The King Isildur kept it and lost it dying by the orcs.
 </p>
  <br>
  
  <p> Three thousand years had passed.And we are at the other side of the middle earth. There were no signs of war in 
  that land called The Shire. The creatures who live in that beautiful and peaceful land were the hobbits.And they were almost all together 
  preparing to celebrate the birthday of his most famous citizen. Bilbo Baggins.
