  <br>
<h2>  <p> The history goes around Jack Sparrow one strange and unpredictable pirate.Traveling on his ship The Black Pearl .
Essentially the history is full of fantasy myths. Curses , ghosts , creatures. Jack is not always the good one on his stories but neither the bad guy.
He only fights for himself.
