<h1>    Review    </h1>

<br>
  <br>
<h2><p>Our story happens in Paris in 1482. The situation in Paris at that time was sensitive violent. A lot of gipsys had been living in Paris from a few moths ago.
  
And they were not welcome at all .Their principal enemy was the powerfull  Catholic Church which  had full control of the government , the law and the army.
A dangerous and powerfull bishop called Frollo started  hunting  the gipsys. "Clean the city of these heretics" . Fires, murders, rapes  for all the country.
But there was a little child who survived for  the mercy of Rollo."I will protect this poor beast". 
 </p>
  <br>
  
  <p> Seventeen years later the child  had grown safe and lonely in the cathedral  of Notre Dame. He was surronded for birds and gargoils as his friends.
   He wasnt allowed to go outside  the cathedral or go down to the chapel. The only human who was allowed to talk it was his sir and savior Rollo.
   His only rol was ring the bells and take care ot them.</p>
