<h1>    Review    </h1>

<br>
  <br>
<h2><p>Our story happens in Paris in 1482. The situation in Paris at that time was sensitive and violent.Since  few moths ago a lot of gipsys had been living in Paris .
  
And they were not welcomed at all .Their principal enemy was the powerfull  Catholic Church which  had full control of the government , the law and the army.
A dangerous and powerfull bishop called Frollo started  hunting  the gipsys. "Clean the city of these heretics" . Fires, murders, rapes  all over the country.
But there was a little child who survived at the mercy of Frollo."I will protect this poor beast". 
 </p>
  <br>
  
  <p> Seventeen years later the child  had grown safe and lonely in the cathedral  of Notre Dame. He was surronded by birds and gargoils as his friends.
   He wasnt allowed to go outside  the cathedral or go down to the chapel. The only human who was allowed to talk it was his sir and savior Frollo.
   His only role was ring the bells and take care ot them.</p>
