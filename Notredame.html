<h1>    Review    </h1>

<br>
  <br>
<h2><p>Our story is located in Paris in 1482. The situation of Paris at this time was sensitive. A lot of gipsys were living in Paris and 
they were not welcome. With the power of  the Catholic Church against them  having control of the government and the law.
A bishop called Frollo started the hunting of the gipsys. "Clean the city of these heretics" . Fires and  murders for all the region.
But there was a little kid who recieved  the mercy of Rollo. 
 </p>
  
  <p> Seventy years later  the kid had grown safe and lonely in the cathedral  of Notre Dame surronded of birds and gargoils as his friends
   He wasnt allowed to go out of the cathedral or down to the chapel. The only human who was allowed to talk was his sir and savior Rollo
   and his only rol was ring the bells and take care ot them.</p>
