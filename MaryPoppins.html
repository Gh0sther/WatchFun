<h2><p>Our story are placed in London around 1910. We have the Banks Family.Almost the perfect family . The father was a banker , the mother was beautiful and very figther for the rights of the women. But the two children... Werent so perfect.One evening when Mr Banks arrived home from the work. The house was in panic , the babysitter was crying for the living room. Aparently the children were missing. They run away from her in the park and she couldn`t find them. The door`s ring bell sound. And a police officer brought the children to home.
 </p>
  <br>
  
  <p>The babysitter quit.Mr Banks was embarrasing and really angry. There was no way to make the children mature. Now he needed a new babysitter enough strict to control their children. He had written a offer in the newspaper . The next morning around forty old ladys appeard in front of the door of Bank`s house wainting to be interviewed.  </p>
