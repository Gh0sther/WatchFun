<h2><p>1940 in the middle of world war two. The movie started in a little village of England. A single lady woman appears and is 
  forced by the army  to take care of three orphans. Suddenly she has to change her way of life and learn how to be a mother.
  It wasnt easy neither for the kids . They just had lost their parents and have to move from their house to a unknow village with a weird lady.</p>
  
  <p>One night they children woke up and discovered that the lady was doing some noises at the basement . Shiny lights were crossing by the 
    bottom of the door. They run away scared to the garden.And when they turned their eyes to the sky. There she was ,flying on a broomstick
    like a scary witch.
