<h2><p>1940 at the middle of world war two the movie started in a little village of England. A single lady woman appears and is 
  forced by the army  to take care of three orphans. Suddenly she has to change her way of life and learn how to be a mother.
  It wasnt easy either for the kids . They just had lose their parents and have to move from their house to a unknow weird lady.</p>
  
  <p>One night they children woke up and discovered that the lady was doing some noises in the basement . Shiny lights crossing at the 
    bottom of the door. They run away scared to the garden. They turned their eyes to the sky and there was she. Flying on a broomstick
    like a sacry witch.
