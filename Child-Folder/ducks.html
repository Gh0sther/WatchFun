<h1>    MIGHTY DUCKS    </h1>

<br>
  <br>
<h2><p> A movies`s saga from 90`s , the eventes takes place in the state of Minesosa, famous for his winter sports . The saga is made for three movies , all 
  very similar each other. The main character is a lawyer,  who was force by the judge to train a group of kids at ice hockey to win the junior cup. 
  These kids were horrible and totally unskilled. Hopefully for them the trainer used to be a great  hockey player  and with so much hard work they finnaly
  won the cup.The team was renamed as "The Ducks". </p>
  
  <p> The plot has not change at all in the last two movies. The junior team had kept growing and throwing new tournaments and new experiences.
  At the second film they kids were already at the highschool and they had to play an international tournament which they would face their principal
  enemys. The iceland team. Despite the hormons and the rebellions. The Ducks got the victory once more.
  In the last movie their last challenge would be face the university team and beat them.What of course they made it. </p>
