<h1>    Review    </h1>

<br>
  <br>
<h2><p> A movie from 1993 , the eventes takes place in Chicago . At first sigth it related the story of a  classic happy family . A marriage with three children.
   However , while the mother called Miranda, was working really hard every day the kids hadnÂ´t paid enough attetion to their studies. Under the watch of their father,
  whose name was Daniel, they were really happy.But their responsabilities were totally ignored.
  The mother , exhausted for   working at the office and also at home had decided break up the marriage.
  In addition Miranda asked to the judge for a restraining order, so she can take the kids  from Daniel.</p>
  
  <p> Nevertheless the father never surrended to get back his family and he was  trying  so hard to  get a proper job , and a nice to house to be allowed 
    to see his children again. Sadly he couldnt find a job as fast as he thought. He was desvastated until he watched a offer in the newspaper. The offer was for babysitter  to take care their 
    own children. With the help of his brother they created the perfect character and costume of a  charming old lady that they called Mrs Doubtfire. </p>
