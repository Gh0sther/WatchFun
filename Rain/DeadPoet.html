<h2><p> At one of the best academys of the United States , the Welton Academy a group of students are ready to start a new year of hight quality
education. And make proud their parents. But this year was quite different , they have a new literature professor.


 </p>
  <br>
  
  <p>The new Professor , called John Keating (played by Robin Williams) was a unusual professor. He wasn't so concerned about the notes.
  He was a student there once. So he knew the teaching methods of the academy. So he wanted to try another thing. He wanted teach their student
  how to think by their own. Bring out their feelings , their passions , their thoughts...
